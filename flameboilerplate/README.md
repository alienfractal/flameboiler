# coolorburn

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.


## Steps

Added fluttergen to manage assests in a more secure way https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_gen 

dart pub global activate flutter_gen
The package flutter_gen is already activated at newest available version.
Warning: Pub installs executables into C:\Users\lien\AppData\Local\Pub\Cache\bin, which is not on your path.
    -Since the path is missing i just called flutter gen directly on the console using that full path to get fluttergen running. 


Tasks are now on the docs folder.

flutter clean
flutter pub get
